## COVID-19 Dashboard using Power BI

### Project Overview
The COVID-19 Dashboard project aims to create an interactive and comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze the impact and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and regionally. The dashboard will provide insights into key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, and recovery rates. This project will serve as a tool for policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public to understand and respond to the pandemic effectively.

### Objectives
1. Visualize COVID-19 data trends from March 2020 to March 14, 2022.
2. Provide regional comparisons of COVID-19 statistics.
3. Identify potential risk areas and forecast future trends.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Confirmed Cases**: The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
2. **Deaths**: The total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
3. **Recoveries**: The total number of recoveries from COVID-19.

### Tools and Technologies
1. **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
2. **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, preparation, and initial analysis.

### Dataset
1. **COVID-19 Case Data**: Provided by Johns Hopkins University, including daily updates on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and region from March 2020 to March 14, 2022.

### Time Frame
- **Week 1-2**: Project Planning and Requirement Gathering
  - Define objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs).
  - Identify data sources and establish data collection methods.
- **Week 3-4**: Data Collection and Preparation
  - Gather data from identified sources covering the period from March 2020 to March 14, 2022.
  - Clean and preprocess data using Excel.
- **Week 5-6**: Dashboard Design and Development
  - Design the layout and user interface of the dashboard in Power BI.
  - Develop data visualizations and interactive elements.
- **Week 7-8**: Implementation and Testing
  - Implement the dashboard in Power BI.
  - Conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy and usability.
  - Incorporate feedback and make necessary adjustments.
- **Week 9-10**: Deployment and Maintenance
  - Deploy the dashboard for public or stakeholder access.
  - Provide documentation and training for users.
  - Establish a maintenance plan for ongoing updates and improvements.

### Key Features
- **Global Overview**: A map visualization showing the spread of COVID-19 with color-coded severity levels.
- **Trend Analysis**: Line charts and bar graphs illustrating trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time from March 2020 to March 14, 2022.
- **Regional Comparison**: Tables and charts comparing COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.
- **Interactive Elements**: Filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities for detailed exploration of the data.

### Expected Outcomes
- A user-friendly and informative dashboard providing up-to-date insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Enhanced ability for stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data.
- Increased public awareness and understanding of the pandemic's impact.

By leveraging Power BI and comprehensive datasets, this project aims to create a valuable resource for ongoing monitoring and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
